title: Getting Started
---

This site is built with Quarto and quartodoc.

Setup
-----

1. Install Quarto CLI and verify:

   ```bash
   quarto check
   ```

2. Install docs dependencies (choose one):

   - With uv (recommended for this repo):
     ```bash
     uv sync --extra docs
     ```
   - With pip extras:
     ```bash
     pip install -e ".[docs]"
     ```

Develop
-------

From the repo root:

```bash
cd docs
quartodoc build --watch   # rebuild API pages on change
quarto preview            # live preview (auto-reload)
```

API pages are auto-generated from docstrings and kept in `docs/reference/`.
